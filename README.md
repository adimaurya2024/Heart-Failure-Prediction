# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Heart plays significant role in living organisms. Heart failure is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Prediction of cardio vascular disease is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. Diagnosis and prediction of heart related diseases requires more precision, perfection and correctness because a little mistake can cause fatigue problem or death of the person, there are numerous death cases related to heart and their counting is increasing exponentially day by day. Machine learning has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the health care industry. Various studies give only a glimpse into predicting heart failure with ML techniques. Here, we design a model that aims at finding significant features by applying machine learning techniques resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of heart failure. There are many to do accomplish this task successfully, but how effective are they? Our main aim is to produce an enhanced performance level with the good accuracy level through the prediction model for heart failure
